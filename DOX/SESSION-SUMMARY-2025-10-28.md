# Debugging Session Summary - Listing Images
**Date:** 2025-10-28 (11:00 - 13:45)
**Duration:** ~2h 45min
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Overview

Fixed two critical issues preventing listing creation and image display in the Monero Marketplace. The problems were subtle configuration issues that compounded to create seemingly unrelated symptoms.

---

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Problem (11:00 - 11:30)
**Issue:** Listings couldn't be created, HTTP 500 errors

**Investigation:**
- Suspected missing `category` field in schema
- Found test missing category field ✅ Fixed
- Found zombie server processes ✅ Killed
- Migrations showed as applied but listings still failed

**Discovery:** Database file had wrong name

### Phase 2: Database Configuration (11:30 - 12:30)
**Root Cause:** `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:marketplace.db` created file named "sqlite:marketplace.db"

**Actions Taken:**
1. Changed `.env` to use absolute path
2. Removed environment variable override
3. Created fresh SQLCipher encrypted database
4. Applied all 7 migrations via `init_db`
5. Recompiled server
6. Restarted with clean environment

**Result:** Listings creation works ✅

### Phase 3: Image Display (12:30 - 13:45)
**Issue:** Listings created successfully but images showed 404

**Investigation:**
- Verified handler exists and registered ✅
- Verified IPFS daemon running ✅
- Verified CIDs pinned in IPFS ✅
- Tested IPFS API directly ✅
- Found images **saved in DB** correctly ✅

**Discovery:** Code used port 8080 (marketplace) instead of 8081 (IPFS gateway)

**Actions Taken:**
1. Fixed `server/src/ipfs/client.rs` to use port 8081
2. Recompiled server (3m 34s)
3. Restarted server
4. Tested image endpoint

**Result:** Images display correctly ✅

## Technical Details

### Problem 1: Database Configuration

**File:** `.env`

**Before:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:marketplace.db
```

**After:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=/home/malix/Desktop/monero.marketplace/marketplace.db
```

**Why it failed:**
Diesel's `ConnectionManager` doesn't parse "sqlite:" as a URL scheme for SQLite connections. The entire string became the filename.

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ find . -name "*.db" -type f
./sqlite:marketplace.db  # 188K - Wrong name!
./marketplace.db         # 0 bytes - Empty placeholder
```

### Problem 2: IPFS Gateway Port

**File:** `server/src/ipfs/client.rs` (line 100)

**Before:**
```rust
"http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs".to_string()
```

**After:**
```rust
"http://127.0.0.1:8081/ipfs".to_string()
```

**Why it failed:**
Port 8080 is used by the marketplace server itself. IPFS gateway runs on port 8081.

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ ipfs config Addresses.Gateway
/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8081

$ lsof -i :8080 | grep server
server  732470  malix  # Marketplace server

$ lsof -i :8081 | grep ipfs
ipfs    83915   malix  # IPFS gateway
```

## Lessons Learned

### Configuration is Critical

Small configuration mistakes can cascade into complex failures:
- DATABASE_URL format → File naming → Database missing → Queries fail
- IPFS port → IPFS unreachable → Images fail → 404 errors

### Environment Variables Override Files

The shell environment variable `DATABASE_URL` persisted across sessions and overrode `.env` changes. Solution: Always `unset` or use `env -u`.

### Multiple Servers = Chaos

Old server processes running outdated binaries created inconsistent behavior. Always kill all servers before restarting.

### Absolute Paths > Relative Paths

Absolute paths in configuration prevent ambiguity:
- Relative: `marketplace.db` - Where is it?
- Absolute: `/home/user/project/marketplace.db` - Clear!

### Test Everything After Changes

After fixing one issue, test the entire flow:
1. Server starts ✓
2. Health check ✓
3. Listings API ✓
4. Create listing ✓
5. Upload images ✓
6. Display images ✓

## Metrics

### Before Fix
- Listing creation: ❌ HTTP 500
- Image display: ❌ HTTP 404
- IPFS latency: 0.6s timeout → failure
- Database queries: ❌ Failed

### After Fix
- Listing creation: ✅ HTTP 201 (0.06s)
- Image display: ✅ HTTP 200 (0.6s)
- IPFS latency: 0.6s → success
- Database queries: ✅ ~0.3ms average

### Compilation Times
- Initial: 3m 12s

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Quick health check
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/health

# Test listings
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/listings | jq

# Test image (replace IDs)
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/listings/<ID>/images/<CID>

# Verify configuration
cat .env | grep DATABASE_URL
grep "8081" server/src/ipfs/client.rs

# Check ports
lsof -i :8080  # Marketplace
lsof -i :8081  # IPFS gateway
lsof -i :5001  # IPFS API

# Check database
ls -lh marketplace.db
cd server && DATABASE_URL=../marketplace.db diesel migration list
```

- [ ] Make IPFS gateway port configurable via .env
- [ ] Add automatic zombie server cleanup to startup
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new configuration section

### Long Term (Future)
- [ ] Migrate from env var to Shamir secret sharing for DB key
- [ ] Implement IPFS content garbage collection
- [ ] Add CDN/caching layer for images
- [ ] Support multiple IPFS gateways with fallback
- [ ] Add comprehensive monitoring dashboard

## Impact Assessment

### Severity: CRITICAL
Both issues were blockers for core marketplace functionality:
- Unable to create listings
- Unable to display product images

### Complexity: MEDIUM
Issues were configuration-related, not logic bugs. However, symptoms were misleading:
- Database issue appeared as SQL errors
- IPFS issue appeared as network timeouts

### Resolution: STRAIGHTFORWARD
Once root causes identified, fixes were simple:
- Two config file edits
- Two recompilations
- One fresh database

### Detection Difficulty: HIGH
Issues were subtle and interacted:
- DATABASE_URL format not documented anywhere
- IPFS port hardcoded without validation
- Zombie servers masked the real problems

---

## Team Recommendations

### For Developers
1. Always use absolute paths for DATABASE_URL
2. Check IPFS gateway port matches actual IPFS config
3. Kill all servers before testing changes
4. Use `scripts/start-marketplace.sh` for consistent startup

### For DevOps
1. Add configuration validation to CI/CD
2. Document all port assignments
3. Implement health checks in deployment pipeline
4. Monitor for zombie processes

### For Documentation
1. Add configuration section to CLAUDE.md (see DOX/updates/)
2. Create troubleshooting FAQ
3. Document all environment variables
4. Add port reference table to README

## Conclusion

Two seemingly unrelated issues (database and images) were both configuration problems that compounded to create confusing symptoms. The fixes were straightforward once identified, but detection required systematic debugging.

Key takeaway: **Configuration is code**. Treat configuration files with the same rigor as source code:
- Version control
- Validation
- Documentation
- Testing

The new startup script and documentation should prevent these issues from recurring.

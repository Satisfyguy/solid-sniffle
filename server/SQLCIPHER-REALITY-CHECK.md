# SQLCipher Implementation - Reality Check

## Date: 2025-10-19
## Component: Database Encryption (SQLCipher)
## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## Specification

**Requirement**: Encrypt the entire SQLite database at rest using SQLCipher to protect sensitive user data (wallet addresses, multisig info, personal information).

**Security Level**: AES-256 encryption with per-connection key verification

**Approach**:
1. Use `libsqlite3-sys` with `bundled-sqlcipher` feature
2. Set encryption key via `PRAGMA key` on every database connection
3. Store encryption key in environment variable `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
4. Reject empty keys in production builds

---

## Implementation

### Code Changes

**File: `server/Cargo.toml`**
```toml
diesel = { version = "2.1.0", features = ["sqlite", "r2d2", "chrono", "returning_clauses_for_sqlite_3_35"] }
diesel_migrations = { version = "2.1.0", features = ["sqlite"] }
libsqlite3-sys = { version = "0.27", features = ["bundled-sqlcipher"] }
```

**File: `server/src/db/mod.rs`**
- Added `SqlCipherConnectionCustomizer` struct implementing `CustomizeConnection`
- Modified `create_pool()` to accept `encryption_key` parameter
- Added production-mode validation (non-empty key required)
- Encryption key applied via `PRAGMA key` on every connection acquisition
- Verification query (`SELECT count(*) FROM sqlite_master`) ensures correct decryption

**File: `server/src/main.rs`**
- Added `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable reading
- Pass encryption key to `create_pool()`

**File: `server/.env.example`**
```bash
# Database Encryption Key (SQLCipher)
# CRITICAL: This key is used to encrypt the entire database at rest
# - Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
# - Store securely, NEVER commit to version control
# - Loss of this key = permanent data loss
# - For development/testing only, use a non-empty string
DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=dev_encryption_key_change_me_in_production
```

### Security Properties

✅ **At-rest encryption**: All database files are encrypted with AES-256
✅ **Key verification**: Wrong key fails immediately on connection
✅ **Production safety**: Empty keys rejected in release builds
✅ **Per-connection security**: Key set on every new connection from pool
✅ **Transparent to application**: Diesel queries work identically after setup

## Testing

### Test File: `server/tests/test_sqlcipher.rs`

**Test 1: Basic Encryption**
- Creates encrypted database with test key
- Verifies connection can be established
- Verifies PRAGMA key is applied correctly

**Test 2: Wrong Key Fails**
- Creates database with correct key
- Attempts to open with wrong key
- Verifies decryption failure

**Test 3: Production Mode (release builds only)**
- Attempts to create pool with empty key
- Verifies rejection in production mode

### Manual Testing

```bash
# 1. Set encryption key
export DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY="test_key_32_characters_minimum_12"

# 2. Start server (creates encrypted DB)
cd server && cargo run

# 3. Verify database is encrypted (should fail without key)
sqlite3 marketplace.db "SELECT * FROM users;"
# Error: file is not a database

# 4. Verify with sqlcipher
sqlcipher marketplace.db
sqlite> PRAGMA key = 'test_key_32_characters_minimum_12';
sqlite> SELECT count(*) FROM sqlite_master;
# Should return count if key is correct
```

---

## Production Deployment

### Key Generation

```bash
# Generate 32-byte (256-bit) encryption key
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Key Storage

**DO NOT**:
- Commit key to version control
- Store in plaintext config files
- Share key in chat/email
- Use weak/predictable keys

**DO**:
- Use secure key management system (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Rotate keys periodically
- Document key backup procedure
- Test key recovery process

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Production server
export DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(cat /secure/path/to/db_key.txt)"

# OR with systemd
[Service]
Environment="DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=..."
EnvironmentFile=/secure/path/to/secrets.env
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] SQLCipher dependency added to Cargo.toml
- [x] `create_pool()` signature updated with encryption_key parameter
- [x] PRAGMA key applied on every connection
- [x] Production mode rejects empty keys
- [x] Environment variable documented in .env.example
- [x] main.rs reads DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY from environment
- [x] Tests created for encryption functionality
- [x] Documentation updated with security warnings

## Performance Impact

**Minimal overhead**: SQLCipher adds ~5-15% CPU overhead for encryption/decryption operations. This is acceptable for the security gain.

**Connection pool**: Using r2d2 connection pooling amortizes the cost of key setup across many queries.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Key rotation not implemented**: Changing encryption key requires database re-encryption
2. **Single key**: All tables encrypted with same key (acceptable for our use case)
3. **No key derivation**: Key used directly (consider PBKDF2 in future)

---

## Security Theatre Check

❌ **NO SECURITY THEATRE DETECTED**

This implementation provides **real, production-ready encryption**:
- Uses industry-standard SQLCipher (AES-256)
- Properly configured with key verification
- Fails safely (wrong key = immediate error)
- No placeholder/stub code

---

## Related Issues

- **Issue #1**: Database must be re-created when changing encryption key (no automated migration)
- **Issue #2**: Key backup/recovery process not yet documented for production

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete basic SQLCipher implementation
2. ⏳ Document key backup/recovery procedures
3. ⏳ Implement automated key rotation (future enhancement)
4. ⏳ Add key derivation function (PBKDF2) for additional security layer

## Sign-off

**Implementation Date**: 2025-10-19
**Implemented By**: Claude Code Agent
**Review Status**: Awaiting code review
**Production Status**: Ready for staging deployment

*This Reality Check confirms that SQLCipher encryption is fully implemented and provides real security, not security theatre.*
